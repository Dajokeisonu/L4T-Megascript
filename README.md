**We did the hard parts so you don't have to!**

## What is this?

The L4T Megascript is an open source multipurpose script for easily installing and updating a diverse collection of programs in L4T Ubuntu, with the purpose of helping new users to install programs and games in just a few steps. Currently designed with 18.04 in mind, but almost everything should be ready for when L4T updates to 20.04. Credit to the Switchroot L4T Ubuntu team (https://switchroot.org/) for making this possible. This project still is in a pretty early stage, but it's more than usable already for most of what's included. Give it a try, and send us feedback!

## Where can I start?
### Go to the wiki for instructions of the first setup:
https://github.com/cobalt2727/L4T-Megascript/wiki/Initial-Setup


## Scripts
We currently have the following scripts: 

- Initial Setup: Installs the swapfile, joycon mouse, 2.0 GHz overclock, SDL2 etc
- Update: Update your programs (APT, Flatpak, maybe someday automatic source code builds)
- Dolphin: Gamecube and Wii emulator, latest development version
- Moonlight-qt: stream games from your PC as long as it has an Nvidia (with Gamestream) or AMD (with Sunshine) GPU!
- CSE2-Tweaks: (CURRENTLY DOWN DUE TO DMCA ON CSE2'S END) An enhanced version of Cave Story. 60 FPS, bugs fixes, other soundtracks support
- SRB2: A 3D open-source Sonic the Hedgehog fangame built using a modified version of Doom
- SRB2Kart: A kart racing game using SRB2 as a base
- RetroPie: Powerful frontend for both emulators and native programs alike
- Celeste (Pico-8 Port): A tight platforming game which lead to the development of Celeste
- Flappy Bird: A game about a bird flying in between warp pipes
- SuperTux2: A 2D jump'n run sidescroller game in a style similar to the original Super Mario games
- SM64Port: A native port of the classic game for the N64 (requires your own, legally dumped ROM)

 We are planning in adding more scripts and functions to the script in future updates.
## Planned features:
- Finish the GUI
- Figure out how to make Citra work
- Figure out how to make Minecraft Bedrock work
- Add the Sodium/Lithium/Phosphor mods (for performance) to the Minecraft script - possibly making them build from source on each run to ensure we don't have to manually update any download links any time a new version's out
-  A lot more listed in the Discord!
